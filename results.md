# CS225 Final Project: OpenFlights Report
##### By: Relena Li, Haosen Yao, Jin Jiang

In this project, we want to explore the [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) dataset to gain insights of how one optimizes their traveling path.
We want to visualize the shortest path (stop wise and distance wise) between two places.

P.S. We ignored all the airports that does not have IATA codes

A summary of our project and its results can be found in this presentation.
