#### **Respect** 

##### To ensure that we have an environment which encourages open expression of ideas, we will be meeting in-person only, since this is the most efficient way to communicate. If we have any disagreements, we will communicate until a compromise can be made. By signing the agreement, it means that all members have agreed on the decisions made.

### Collaboration

#### **Work Distribution** 

##### At the time of writing this contract, we will split the work equally between us three, since we don't currently know the strengths or weaknesses of us. If unforseen work occurs, we will communicate and assign the work to anyone who have time at the  moment.

##### If a conflict occurs, we will first try to resolve it within our group, such as communicating with the member and ask if anything is going wrong. Only if we cannot resolve it by ourselves will we ask the course staff for help.
